[{"content":"Overview This paper studies the causal impact of social media exposure during college on later earnings, using the staggered introduction of Facebook across U.S. universities as a natural experiment. The main finding is that greater exposure to Facebook during undergraduate studies is associated with lower wages after graduation, with effects that are strongest early on and fade over time.\nIntroduction Social media changed how students communicate and spend time, but its effect on long-run labor market outcomes is still not fully understood. This paper asks a simple question:\nHow did access to Facebook during college affect graduates’ earnings one, five, and ten years later?\nThe paper exploits a key institutional fact: Facebook was rolled out across colleges at different times between 2004 and 2006, before becoming publicly available in 2006. This staggered expansion creates quasi-experimental variation in social media exposure during university years.\nData The analysis combines two data sources:\nFacebook college rollout dates (from replication files used in prior work, based on archived data) PSEO (Post-Secondary Employment Outcomes) Earnings, which reports aggregate earnings by institution, major, cohort, and percentile (25th, 50th, 75th), measured one, five, and ten years after graduation. Matched sample After merging sources, the paper matches 111 universities that received Facebook before it became public and that can be linked to PSEO data. The final analysis focuses on undergraduates, motivated by high Facebook take-up rates among that group in the early rollout period.\nExposure measure Because individual Facebook usage is not observed, the paper constructs an institution-cohort exposure variable:\nnormalized from 0 (no exposure during undergraduate years) to 1 (full exposure during undergraduate years) This variable measures the share of undergraduate years in which a cohort at a given institution had access to Facebook.\nEmpirical Strategy The core empirical design is a difference-in-differences style specification using quasi-experimental variation from staggered Facebook rollout.\nThe outcome is:\nlog(earnings) at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles, measured 1, 5, and 10 years after graduation. The main regressor is the cohort-level Facebook exposure measure, with controls for:\ngraduation cohort fixed effects, institution and major effects, and institution–major structure (as in the paper’s fixed-effects setup). Identification assumptions The interpretation relies on:\nStable selection into institutions and majors across cohorts Parallel trends in wages across treated and untreated institutions (within major), absent Facebook exposure The baseline specification compares pre-treatment cohorts (2001–2003) to post-treatment cohorts (2007–2009), excluding the intermediate 2004–2006 cohorts because exposure is harder to assign cleanly in those grouped data.\nMain Results The paper finds a negative and persistent effect of Facebook exposure on wages.\n1 year after graduation Full undergraduate exposure to Facebook is associated with wage declines of roughly:\n-3.7% at the 25th percentile -3.9% at the median -3.6% at the 75th percentile 5 years after graduation The negative effect remains but is smaller (around -1.1% at the median).\n10 years after graduation The effect is close to zero and no longer statistically meaningful in the baseline estimates.\nNonlinear exposure effect The paper also estimates specifications with a quadratic exposure term. The positive coefficient on exposure-squared suggests that the negative wage effect grows more slowly at higher exposure levels (i.e., diminishing marginal harm). A possible interpretation is that the initial arrival of social media is more disruptive, while students later adapt their routines.\nInterpretation The paper interprets the results through a simple work–leisure framework:\nFacebook increases time spent on social activity / distraction Students study less Academic performance (e.g., GPA) falls Lower academic performance weakens labor market bargaining power and reduces wages This mechanism is not directly observed in the data, but it provides an intuitive explanation for the short- to medium-run earnings effects.\nHeterogeneity Analysis The paper groups majors into:\nSTEM Humanities Social Sciences Others and estimates a triple-differences specification to test whether effects vary by field.\nMain takeaway There is no single subgroup that cleanly drives the overall result, but the point estimates suggest:\nHumanities students may be the most affected Social Sciences appear less affected (in point-estimate terms) However, standard errors overlap substantially, so subgroup differences should be interpreted cautiously.\nPlacebo Tests and Sensitivity Analysis The paper performs two robustness exercises.\n1) Placebo cohort tests It assigns “synthetic” Facebook exposure to cohorts that should not exhibit treatment variation (or where treatment timing should not matter) and re-runs the main specification.\nResult: placebo estimates are generally null / insignificant, which supports the identification strategy and parallel-trends assumption.\n2) Randomization inference For the 1-year outcome, exposure is randomly reassigned across universities (10,000 times), and the regression is re-estimated.\nResult: the observed estimates are far from the randomization distribution, suggesting the main effect is very unlikely to be due to chance.\nLimitations The paper highlights several limitations:\nThree-cohort aggregation in PSEO\nThis blurs treatment timing (especially for cohorts around 2009) It weakens the precision of exposure assignment Limited control for the 2008 financial crisis\nCohort fixed effects absorb only an average cohort shock Residual differential effects may still bias estimates These limitations suggest the estimates are informative but should be interpreted with appropriate caution.\nConclusion Using the staggered rollout of Facebook across U.S. colleges, this paper provides quasi-experimental evidence that social media exposure during college reduced post-graduation wages in the short run, with effects that persist for several years and largely fade by ten years after graduation.\nThe results are consistent with a distraction-based mechanism and suggest that digital technologies can have economically meaningful effects on human capital accumulation and early-career labor market outcomes.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/research/social-media-wages/","summary":"Overview This paper studies the causal impact of social media exposure during college on later earnings, using the staggered introduction of Facebook across U.S. universities as a natural experiment.

An analysis of Facebook effect on college graduates earnings"},{"content":"Overview This paper studies how censorship on social media affects polarization, disagreement, and internal conflict using a formal opinion dynamics model. The central result is a trade-off: stronger censorship tends to increase polarization but reduce internal conflict, while the effect on disagreement depends on how connected the network is and how much cross-group communication exists.\nIntroduction Social media platforms increasingly shape real-world opinion formation, but governance and regulation remain limited. This creates an important policy question: what are the welfare effects of censorship on social media? In particular:\nDoes censorship reduce harmful conflict, or does it deepen polarization? Is there an optimal level of censorship? Does the answer depend on homophily (whether people mostly talk to like-minded users versus across groups)? The paper approaches these questions through a stylized opinion dynamics framework with two opposing groups, where a platform/network administrator chooses a censorship threshold before opinions evolve.\nRelated Literature (Brief) The paper connects three strands of literature:\nOpinion dynamics, especially models like DeGroot, bounded confidence, and Friedkin–Johnsen. Freedom of speech and moderation in social media, including concerns about arbitrary censorship and platform control over information flow. Social media and welfare, where much of the empirical literature focuses on well-being and life satisfaction rather than formal network-level opinion dynamics. A key contribution here is to provide a quantitative framework for studying censorship as a policy variable in a social network.\nMethodology 1) Network structure The model assumes a network of n agents split into two equally sized groups with opposing viewpoints (think of them as two ideological camps).\nOpinions lie on a continuous interval [-1, 1] Left-group innate opinions are distributed on [-1, 0] Right-group innate opinions are distributed on [0, 1] The two distributions are symmetric around zero Communication intensity is parameterized by:\np: within-group communication intensity q: across-group communication intensity This allows the paper to study both high-homophily and low-homophily environments.\n2) Opinion dynamics (Friedkin–Johnsen) Each agent starts with an innate opinion and updates over time by combining:\ntheir own innate view (stubbornness), and the opinions of their neighbors (weighted by communication intensity). Opinions evolve until they reach an equilibrium.\n3) Censorship as a threshold rule Censorship is modeled as a threshold policy chosen by a network administrator.\nLet c ∈ [0,1] be the censor point. Agents with opinions outside [-c, c] are banned. Banned agents keep their current opinion and stop participating in further opinion formation. Important convention in the paper:\nSmaller c = stronger censorship (because fewer opinions are allowed) 4) Welfare measures The paper evaluates censorship using three equilibrium outcomes:\nPolarization Measures dispersion of opinions (variance-like concept).\nDisagreement Measures how far apart connected agents are in equilibrium (weighted by network ties).\nInternal Conflict Measures how far each agent’s equilibrium opinion moves from their innate opinion.\nFinally, welfare is defined as a weighted negative sum of these three costs:\nhigher polarization = worse higher disagreement = worse higher internal conflict = worse So welfare depends on policy weights over the three indices.\nMain Results General case The paper derives analytical and numerical results for the expected effects of censorship.\n1) More censorship increases polarization As censorship becomes stronger, extreme users are removed from interaction, so they stop updating and remain at more extreme opinions. This raises equilibrium polarization.\n2) More censorship reduces internal conflict When fewer people interact, opinions move less from their original values, so internal conflict declines.\n3) Disagreement is non-monotonic The effect on disagreement depends on network size and connectivity:\nIn smaller / weakly connected networks, disagreement tends to decrease with censorship In larger / highly connected networks, disagreement may initially increase and only later decline This is one of the paper’s most interesting findings: censorship can simultaneously reduce communication while increasing distance between surviving opinions in some parameter regions.\nWelfare and Optimal Censorship Because censorship affects polarization, disagreement, and internal conflict differently, the welfare effect is not one-directional.\nThe paper shows that depending on:\nnetwork connectivity (p, q, n) and welfare weights (how much the administrator cares about polarization vs disagreement vs internal conflict) the optimal policy may be:\nno censorship partial censorship near-total / total censorship In other words, there is no single universal moderation rule — the “best” censorship level is parameter-dependent.\nRole of Homophily A major contribution of the paper is showing how censorship effects change with network homophily.\nExtremely high homophily (q = 0) Agents only communicate within their own group.\nCensorship has a smaller effect overall Opinions are already evolving mostly inside echo chambers Removing cross-group interaction does not change much (because it was already absent) Extremely low homophily (q = p) Agents communicate across groups as much as within groups.\nCensorship has a stronger effect Cross-group communication normally helps pull opinions closer together Censorship shuts down that mixing, so the welfare and disagreement effects become more pronounced A key takeaway is that censorship matters more in networks where cross-group exchange is active.\nInterpretation This framework highlights why moderation policy is hard:\nCensorship can reduce conflict-like outcomes (especially internal conflict, sometimes disagreement) But it can also entrench ideological distance and increase polarization So moderation is not just a “more vs less” question — it is a design problem shaped by:\nnetwork structure, communication patterns, and the platform’s objective function. Limitations and Future Work The paper explicitly notes that the model takes the perspective of a welfare-oriented network administrator. A natural extension is to model a profit-maximizing platform instead, where moderation policy also depends on:\nenforcement costs, engagement, user retention, and platform incentives. Another important next step is empirical calibration using real-world social media data (e.g., Twitter/X or Reddit) to estimate network and opinion parameters.\nCitation Krasowski, Kacper.

A key preview result is that GenAI can worsen outcomes, but not always: it improves AI-side aggregation and may reduce production costs, but it can also divert traffic away from the web and reduce incentives to produce original content.\nIntroduction The motivating research question is:\nHow does Generative AI (GenAI) affect online content supply and quality?\nThe presentation frames this as a two-sided equilibrium problem:\nOn the demand side, users decide whether to search the Web directly or rely on AI. On the supply side, firms/providers decide whether it is profitable to create information online. GenAI affects both sides simultaneously: it is a substitute for the Web in users’ choice set, and a technology shock that can reduce content production costs. The broader research agenda is to first build a transparent theoretical framework and then bring the data to the model in future work.\nMethodology 1) Environment The model includes three objects:\nUsers Mass 1. Search for information online. Choose between: AI (an aggregated source), or the Web (a collection of sources/providers). Providers (the Web) There are m potential providers. Each provider has heterogeneous quality. Providers choose whether to enter and produce content (Melitz-style entry decision). GenAI Aggregates information available online. Competes with the Web for user attention. May reduce the cost of content provision. 2) User Side Users derive utility from either the AI channel or a web source.\nLet Q_k denote the quality of web source k, δ_W the baseline preference for the web, and ϕ AI ability.\nUtility For user i:\nAI option U_{iA} = ln(Q_A) + ε_{iA}\nWeb source k U_{ik} = ln(δ_W) + ln(Q_k) + ε_{ik}\nwhere the taste shocks follow a GEV structure: ε_i ~ GEV(θ).\nUsers choose the source that maximizes utility.\nAI aggregation technology AI aggregates content from the web according to:\nQ_A = ϕ (Σ_k Q_k^(1/θ))^θ\nThis means AI quality improves with:\nstronger AI ability ϕ, and better/more abundant underlying web content. 3) Demand Shares The model yields closed-form demand shares.\nShare going to AI s_A = ϕ / (δ_W + ϕ)\nIncreases with AI ability ϕ Decreases with web preference δ_W Share going to the Web s_W = δ_W / (δ_W + ϕ)\nDecreases with AI ability ϕ Increases with web preference δ_W Share of web traffic to provider k (conditional on using the Web) s_{k|W} = Q_k^(1/θ) / Σ_j Q_j^(1/θ)\nSo higher-quality web sources attract a larger share of web users.\n4) Provider Side (Entry / Content Supply) Providers differ in quality and decide whether to produce.\nHeterogeneity Each provider draws quality from a Pareto distribution: Q_k ~ Pareto(γ).\nProfits Provider k earns:\nπ_k = r s_k - F(1 - η)\nwhere:\nr = revenue per unit of user share, s_k = user share obtained by provider k, F = fixed cost of production, η = cost reduction from AI (higher η means lower costs). The provider produces iff: π_k ≥ 0.\nEntry cutoff There is a quality threshold Q_0 such that providers enter only if their quality is high enough. The cutoff satisfies the zero-profit condition:\nr s(Q_0) - F(1 - η) = 0.\nFrom the presentation, the implied cutoff is:\nQ_0 = [ (F m γ) / (r(γ - 1/θ)) * (1 - η) * ((δ_W + ϕ) / δ_W) ]^(1/γ)\nComparative statics:\nQ_0 decreases with η (lower costs make entry easier) Q_0 increases with ϕ (AI steals traffic, making entry harder) Active content supply The mass/share of active providers is:\nm_A = Q_0^(-γ)\nSo:\nm_A increases with cost reduction (η) m_A decreases with AI demand diversion (ϕ) This captures the central supply-side tradeoff:\nAI can help providers via lower costs, but AI can also hurt providers by taking users away from the web. 5) Consumed Quality The object of interest is the quality actually consumed by users:\nQ^e = s_A Q_A + s_W Σ_{k∈A} s_{k|W} Q_k\nThis is a weighted average of:\nquality consumed through AI, and quality consumed through direct web browsing. Because both demand shares and provider entry respond to AI, the net effect of GenAI on consumed quality is generally ambiguous.\nMain Mechanisms and Economic Intuition The model highlights two opposing forces:\nForce 1: AI improves aggregation (quality-enhancing) Higher ϕ makes AI a better aggregator. Users may receive higher-quality information through the AI channel. This tends to increase consumed quality on the AI side. Force 2: AI cannibalizes web traffic (supply-reducing) As ϕ rises, a larger share of users chooses AI instead of the web. Web providers lose traffic and revenue. Some providers stop producing content, reducing the supply of original information. Force 3: AI reduces costs for providers (supply-enhancing) Higher η lowers fixed production costs. More providers can profitably enter. This supports information supply and can improve the quality of content available for both the web and AI to use. The key result is that GenAI is not unambiguously good or bad: its effect depends on the balance between demand diversion and cost reduction.\nWhat the Model Predicts The presentation emphasizes the following qualitative predictions: Higher AI ability (ϕ)\nincreases AI usage (s_A) decreases direct web usage (s_W) tends to reduce incentives for web content production may improve AI-side quality aggregation Higher cost reduction (η)\nlowers entry costs increases active web content supply can offset part of the demand-diversion effect from AI This creates regions where:\nGenAI reduces information supply and lowers quality, but also regions where cost reductions are strong enough that GenAI can improve outcomes. Current Scope and Next Steps This presentation is a first theoretical step in a larger project.\nCurrent stage A simple, tractable equilibrium model of: user choice, provider entry, and AI aggregation. Next stage Bring data to the model Calibrate / estimate key parameters Evaluate whether observed changes in web content and user behavior align with the model’s predictions Conclusion This project provides a clean framework for thinking about how GenAI changes the internet economy.\nThe core insight is a general equilibrium tradeoff:\nGenAI can improve information access by aggregating content more effectively, but it can also weaken the underlying incentive to produce original content online. Whether GenAI ultimately improves or degrades the online information environment depends on:\nhow strong AI is as a substitute for the web (ϕ), how much it lowers content production costs (η), and how users value direct web browsing (δ_W).
